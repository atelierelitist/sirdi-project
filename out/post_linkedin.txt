🔐 SOVEREIGN FOUNDERS CIRCLE — 5 Executive Seats Available

**The Problem:** Your infrastructure audit trail is fiction. When regulators, investors, or compliance teams ask "prove your deployment integrity," you have logs that could be fabricated in minutes.

**The Protocol:** Sovereign Stack transforms chaos into cryptographically verifiable order. Every operation signed (signify-openbsd). Every deployment provable. Every audit trail immutable.

**The Proof:** 
• Cryptographically signed operations & logs
• Hardware sovereignty (no cloud vendor lock-in)  
• Self-teaching automation with verifiable runbooks

**The Scarcity:** 5 seats. £25k initiation + £15k advisory. Upside participation (0.25% warrant OR 1% revenue share, 24mo).

This isn't consulting—it's infrastructure transformation that scales from startup to IPO.
