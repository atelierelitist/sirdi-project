🚨 SOVEREIGN FOUNDERS CIRCLE — 5 SEATS ONLY 🚨

Your startup's infrastructure is chaos. Unverifiable deployments. No audit trail. Zero cryptographic proof.

Meanwhile, your competitors are building on quicksand.

Time to go sovereign. 🧵

---

The problem: Every "DevOps" consultant gives you the same playbook.

Docker + K8s + "monitoring" + prayers.

But when regulators ask "prove your deployment integrity" or investors demand "show me the audit trail"...

You have nothing. Just logs that could be faked.

Introducing: Sovereign Stack Protocol

• Cryptographically signed operations (signify-openbsd)
• Immutable audit trails with genesis verification
• Self-teaching automation (Auggie + brain/)
• Hardware sovereignty (no cloud dependencies)

Every action is PROVABLE. Every log is SIGNED.

---

What you get in the Founders Circle:

• Sovereign Stack Audit — integrity, automation, evidence
• 14-day Implementation Sprint — Auggie rituals, signed logs, runbooks
• Sovereign Seed (Pi kit) — preconfigured, delivered
• Proof Pack — cryptographically signed reports & HOW-TOs

---

This isn't consulting. This is transformation.

From chaos → verifiable order
From trust → cryptographic proof
From vendor lock-in → true sovereignty

Your infrastructure becomes a competitive moat, not a liability.

The terms:
• £25,000 initiation (Audit + Sprint)
• £15,000 mandatory 90-day Advisory
• Upside: 0.25% warrant OR 1% revenue share (24mo, capped 2× fees)

Total investment: £40k for infrastructure that scales to IPO.

---

Why only 5 seats?

Because this requires deep, hands-on work. No cookie-cutter solutions.

Each engagement is custom-architected for your specific stack, compliance needs, and growth trajectory.

Quality over quantity. Always.
