# Quest #1 â€” The Sovereign Citizen's Primer

**Outcome:** You understand the core doctrine (sovereignty, security, proof), can set up a sovereign workstation, and can produce a verifiable proof package.

## Modules

1. Orientation: Sovereignty, Proof, and Ethics
2. Secure Workstation Basics (WSL, keys, signatures)
3. Veritas: How to produce evidence & hashes
4. The Badge: What gets minted and why

## Final Verification Task

Produce a `proof/` folder containing:

- `report.md` (answers to the rubric questions)
- 3 screenshots: keygen, signed commit, and hashes
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` (hashes of all evidence files)

Submit the folder to a reviewer (or PR). Attestation + badge are issued on pass.
